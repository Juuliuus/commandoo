"\n"
"If you are working away from your main computer, you can take commandoo with you. It is a simple matter to set up commandoo on a USB drive AND force it to use a \"config\" folder on that USB drive.\n"
"\n"
"The first step is to copy the commandoo AppImage file you use to the USB drive in an appropriate folder (the file you are using now is \"%s\"). \n"
"\n"
"Then, in the same folder you copied the AppImage to make a new folder with the same name as the AppImage file but with \".config\" added to the end of it. For example, say you copy the AppImage to:\n"
"/myusb/commandoo/commandoo.AppImage\n"
"\n"
"Then simply make the following empty folder:\n"
"/myusb/commandoo/commandoo.AppImage.config/\n"
"\n"
"Done. Now run the AppImage from the USB drive. commandoo will automatically use the AppImage.config folder for its settings and DB's. Since the first run will be a \"new\" run, the default \"DB\" databases will be created. You can now use the 'Profile management import function' to grab any DB's you want from your normal config folder. If you have worked only from the original default \"DB\" database, import it in with a new name and use that, or merge it with the default \"DB\" that was created.\n"
"\n"
"==> NOTE: The location of the sqlite3 library file varies from Distro to Distro. It can be that you are moving to a machine where that library is in a different path! This means you WILL NOT be able to use a sql database because commandoo won't know where sqlite is! You can fix this each time in options, yes. But I would recommend that the safest and easiest solution is to convert any sql databases you have on the USB drive to text based databases using the supplied 'Profile management convert function'. Then there is no sqlite3 library issues and the databases can be used on any distro.\n"
"\n"
"CONSIDERATIONS =========\n"
"\n"
"It can be that you have commands in your database that are not installed on the other machine. commandoo can't immediately know that and the command will fail even though it says it is on a \"good\" path. It is either on a different path, or not installed. It is easy to test if it should be in the path on the other machine: edit the command, double-click its name, then just accept that name. commandoo will always try to find out if it is in $PATH. It could be that it is not in $PATH but in a non-PATH folder. Use the same procedure but point to its path on the other machine, if it is installed. Finally, if it not corrected by these standard steps then it is not installed and either must be installed or simply not used.\n"
"\n"
"Considerations when you run a GUI program as a child process:  let's take \"gimp\" for example. If you run gimp through commandoo as a child process, gimp will use commandoo's ENVIRONMENT and save its config settings to the AppImage.config folder you created! This is actually a good thing, in that the other machines gimp settings will not be changed. You will notice, as you use the USB drive, that other files will be written into the AppImage.config folder.\n"
"\n"
"There may be other things that will arise when using the USB AppImage that I haven't run into yet. So best practice is to make your USB AppImage and then test it yourself under a variety of circumstances and Distros as possible.\n"

"If you upgraded commandoo from the original version 1.0.1...\n"
"\n"
"...you will notice your customized databases aren't shown! But it is easy to point to them in just a few clicks.\n"
"\n"
"This new commandoo is future-proofed (!?), but the old one was not. \n"
"\n"
"The easiest way is to go to options and use the \"Base/DB folder\" button to choose the folder where your old databases are. Confirm, close commandoo, and re-start. Voila, all is right with the world. \n"
"\n"
"The other easy way, only a bit more work, is to use the \"Manage DB Profiles\" button, and then use the new IMPORT function. You can then import your custom DB's one at a time into the new config area. \n"
"\n"
"What, exactly, has changed? The old commandoo simply looked in the same folder where it was installed. The new commandoo queries the system for the system determined user config folder (usually .config). But, as you now know, this can be over-ridden as described. \n"
"\n"
"Would it be better to import which moves everything to the new config folder? It is entirely up to you, commandoo doesn't =care= where they are, it just needs to =know= where they are. If there is any advantage to importing it would be that the final structure is in line with gnu/linux quidelines and, in that way, \"future-proofed\".\n"
"\n"
"By the way, if you import your DB's, it does not destroy the original files, they will still be in their original location. This is true of any imported DB.\n"
"\n"
"By this time you probably have thought that this would be a neat way of keeping separate folders of DB's for different purposes and simply using this DB path to move between them. Yeah, you can do that now. The only reason I don't recommend this method is that you could start getting confused as to what is where, and start making edits in one folder that you meant to make in another.\n"

"\"ibus\" is a gnu/linux input method (ie., keyboard entries) that is installed in many linux's by default.\n"
"\n"
"In some older versions of gnu/linux ibus CAN CAUSE PROGRAM MISBEHAVIOR, making commandoo unusable. The problem and solution are outlined below. You may want to use the save to file button below, so that you can open it separately from this window.\n"
"\n"
"==================== \n"
"The Problem: \n"
"Typed characters are doubled in some cases (solution below) \n"
"==================== \n"
"\n"
"In August 2017 (first official release of commandoo), I tested commandoo in a fresh Debian 9 cinnamon desktop. I found that the GTK version had the problem of doubled characters. That is, you type \"dog\" and you get \"ddoogg\", etc. This may be a problem in Debian 8 as well. \n"
"\n"
"Later in October a fresh install of KDE desktop Debian 9 also had this problem in the QT version. \n"
"\n"
"This was, of course, quite annoying. \n"
"\n"
"The problem is due to the program \"ibus\". ibus is an input method utility. It is designed to allow asian country users to type in their native language characters/idiograms: chinese, japanese, etc. So if you are not in Asia the program is not essential. However, it IS installed BY DEFAULT in fresh english installs of Debian. \n"
"\n"
"After finally testing (and researching) this thoroughly I found that the problem is rooted in ibus, or at least it's implementation. I can say this with confidence because while Lazarus programs have this problem it is ALSO A PROBLEM in KDE desktop environment (at least at this time, maybe it will be fixed??). \n"
"\n"
"On the fresh KDE install not only was commandoo affected but KDE windows (like kdesudo) failed, one can not type into the input fields. It also affects typing in the KDE kicker when trying to find some installed program, only the first typed character was displayed. Web research showed that many people were having this problem with KDE and Debian 9 and ibus. \n"
"\n"
"You can see immediately if you are affected by this problem. Simply close this window and continue on into commandoo. Focus the command list and type alt-F to open the find dialog and type \"dog\". If \"dog\" is the result then you do not have this problem. If it comes out only \"d\" or as \"ddoogg\" then you do have the problem and should apply the solution. \n"
"\n"
"When I discovered this back in August I recommended either removing ibus (if you are not typing asian characters) or a \"Fix\" I had found on the internet that seemed to work (setting some environment variables in .bashrc). Further testing in October with KDE showed the .bashrc \"solution\" was not effective though it had worked for me in August with GTK. That turned out to be due to how GTK enironment variable is set deep in the IM (input method) configuration files. So the solution DID NOT work with QT. At the time I had intended to try QT also but then the problem of not being able to use the GUI sudo commands (see above) convinced me that the KDE debian 9 install was flawed and I didn't bother. \n"
"\n"
"But, finally, in October I tried it again, and still KDE/PLasma wouldn't work properly (for example, one can not open synaptic package manager, while the password dialog shows you can't type anything into it! Ouch.). \n"
"\n"
"So I resolved to figure out the issue, and I did. Solution follows. \n"
"\n"
"==================== \n"
"Solution: \n"
"==================== \n"
"\n"
"As I said, I initially, in part, recommended removing ibus from your system if you didn't need it. \n"
"\n"
"And, as someone pointed out on the internet, to paraphrase: While ibus is now the default input method it doesn't mean you have to use it. There are other im's out there and you can set the system to use those (they also have to do with asian characters). And removing ibus should have no deleterious effects if you don't need it. \n"
"\n"
"So there is still that \"solution\". If you are having the doubled character problems you can temporarily see the \"fix\" immediately. Simply type \"ibus exit\" in a terminal. Go back into commandoo and the doubled character problem will be gone. But this is temporary, only shutting ibus down for the current session. On your next login ibus will be restarted. \n"
"\n"
"So removal of ibus will work. But I resolved to make my system work WITH ibus installed. And so here is the new tested and recommended solution: \n"
"\n"
"There turns out to be a small utility called im-config with which you can disable the asian character sub-system. \n"
"\n"
"You need to run it as root in this format:  sudo im-config -c \n"
"\n"
"The -c opens it in an interactive console mode in a terminal window. \n"
"\n"
"It will first list what the system currently is. This is usually defaulting to ibus. \n"
"\n"
"It will ask if you want to continue (yes). \n"
"\n"
"Then a screen will appear with your options. Use arrow keys to move to NONE choice, press spacebar to select it, then tab to OK and enter. \n"
"\n"
"NOTE: if you run im-config again it STILL says ibus is automatic, but this is not true absolutely, just in \"theory\" I guess (I really think someone, Linus?, needs to look into this mess), because if you continue you will see that the choice is still \"none\", which is correct. \n"
"\n"
"After this process logout/reboot and, voila, the system works. KDE works, I was able to open synaptic package manager, commandoo worked. The KDE Plasma Kicker worked. And ibus is still installed. \n"
"\n"
"I would apologize for the mess of this but it is the ibus team that should. \n"

"Introduction:\n"
"============ \n"
"\n"
"Welcome to commandoo the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), perhaps better known as the \"Terminal\". \n"
"\n"
"It's purpose is to give you a place to store the cool and/or useful command lines you find, discover, or create. Then, months later, when you need it again, it will be here, easy to find. \n"
"\n"
"It's primary audience was intended for people new to Linux, but the features and usefulness of storing command lines could be of interest for veteran users too. \n"
"\n"
"You can copy the Command Line with a right click and paste into a Terminal to use...Or...\n"
"\n"
"...you can run it from within this program. Commandoo is NOT a terminal replacement, but it's been designed to be as useful as possible and running Command Line's seemed like a nice feature. \n"
"\n"
"Other features: \n"
"\n"
"** Commands and Command Lines can be marked as to how dangerous they are, and you can optionally set that a particular danger level (harmless, careful, caution, danger) needs confirmation before running. \n"
"\n"
"** You can mark a command line to take input from you, before running. Not all Commands pay any attention to input (stdin) but for the ones that do this is kind of a cool feature. Think grep for instance. \n"
"\n"
"** You can test your command lines while editing them. The only thing this program does NOT provide is a shell within which to run commands. So running commands from here like \"cd\", \"pwd\", \"alias\" and some others like these are, well, useless to run from here. But even these are included in the database for reference since the program can show the command's help text for you. \n"
"\n"
"** You can add any number of self defined keywords to a command and these, of course, are searchable. \n"
"\n"
"There is one other thing to know about the absence of a \"true\" shell: you can't change directories (cd) to run a command in that directory. For instance, if you choose to add \"git\" to your Commands you need to use it with the \"-C <path>\" flag. This is true of any command like git, you will need to use pathing and appropriate flags to run it. And the last BIG difference: any command that expects input will NOT run properly because I haven't figured out how to communicate (yet) with a running process in a shell-like manner waiting for input. These have to be run in a terminal. \n"
"\n"
"You can choose to use text based database files or sqlite db files. You can convert from one to the other. You can merge from one to the other. You can send individual Command Lines from your open DB and send it to another DB. You can import DB's from other commandoo users. You can compare DB's. You can mix and match all these functions to manipulate your DB's at will. \n"
"\n"
"You can edit a Command and a CL at the same time. \n"
"\n"
"This is completely \"open\" software, the source code is on GitHub, see the link in the \"About\" window. It is written in pascal (thank you FreePascal) with the Lazarus IDE (thank you Lazarus). \n"
"\n"
"Help is included in the program. Almost all windows have a checkbox in the upper right to \"show hints on mouse-over\". Check that and then move the mouse over the control you have a question about. Uncheck it when you're done.\n"
"\n"
"A word of CAUTION:     Be careful out there. \n"
"\n"
"Linux comes with very powerful commands to use, really cool ones. But they can be dangerous if misused and/or misunderstood. As they say with great power comes great responsibility. \n"
"\n"
"If you don't know whether a command is dangerous or not then you really need to educate yourself about that command. Hopefully this database will help you with that. I will try to be as thorough as possible in the database descriptions of a command's merits. And, in the original database coming with this program, if I have marked a command line as harmless then it IS harmless you can be certain. If a command line is marked careful or higher then you may want to spend some time learning about that command so you understand WHY it is not completely harmless. \n"
"\n"
"Another word of CAUTION:  Backup your database files regularly. File locations can be seen in the \"About\" window. And now License Information: \n"

"===== \n"
"\n"
"Commands are entries that describe the command you are using. Commands >> CAN NOT BE RUN <<. Only Command Lines (CL's) can be run, but you must add the command first. Then you add command lines to it. \n"
"\n"
"Before adding Command Lines you should edit your new Command and give it a threat level and so on. This is because any command lines you add will \"inherit\" those settings saving you some work. \n"
"\n"
"%s\n"
"\n"
"When adding a new command simply type in the name. If it is in the $PATH it will be found automatically. If the command/file is not in the path you will need to type the path or use the browse button.\n"
"\n"
"If you want to change the Command's name (or path) then open the Command in edit mode and Dbl-Click the Command Name. \n"
"\n"
"commandoo supports variables in Command Lines. Select the CL you want and go into edit mode. Then use the CL builder/helper button and you will be taken to a edit window that has buttons to allow you to enter various types of variables (strings, integer, real, and file/folder names).  \n"
"\n"
"Look through the provided database, there are examples of variables, Command Line input, etc. \n"
"\n"
"One cool options is \"Alert\". If this is checked then the program makes you look at the notes for that Command Line. This can be really useful if you need to be aware of something, or having done something, BEFORE you run that command line. Try it. \n"
"\n"
"If you want commandoo to act as a \"launcher\" be sure to check the \"Child Proc\" checkbox in the Command Line. Otherwise, it will (usually) return immediately, having not done anything. Say you are running Gimp or Blender, well sending it out to be run like \"uname\" does precisely that. It runs it, and then stops and kills it. The Child Proc setting says \"hey, this is a GUI program, keep it open\". \n"
"\n"
"\"Use Shell\" attempts to let the system handle it and this usually works pretty well. It is necessary for processes that use more terminal like syntax (semicolons and such). commandoo can internally handle the basic command lines, but if yours doesn't seem to work, try \"Use Shell\" and see if that does it. If not then that Command Line should only be run in a Terminal (term. only). \n"
"\n"
"If the Command Line is mission critical, complex, etc. you should probably only use it in a Terminal. commandoo is pretty good at performing most CL's but IT IS NOT A TERMINAL, be aware of that and use your best judgement on where commandoo can/should be used and where a Terminal should be used. \n"
"\n"
"\"Wants Input\" is pretty cool (I think). On Commands that accept input (like, for instance, grep) marking this option for a Command Line will ask you for input before running the Command Line. So for something like grep you can paste in some text you want to search. \n"
"\n"
"The \"SuperUser\" setting only marks the CL that it should/will be run as root in a terminal. Setting this adds a \"<root> \" at the beginning of the CL. Later if you need this command, copy it from commandoo's right click menu, then when you paste it in a terminal it will fill the CL out for you with the proper superuser command, ie., <root> alias will be pasted as sudo alias. What <root> get's replaced with is from a template you can set from OPTIONS. You can not / may not run sudo or su commands from within commandoo, they must be run in a terminal. I have had success, however, with pkexec which I use from commandoo to mount a ram drive. So try pkexec too. Success of running CL's with pkexec permissions will depend on your system's policies.\n"
"\n"
"Use DB profiles, why not? The provided database is of basic Linux commands. Now you can add more and more to this database as you like, fine. But you could also make specific databases for specific needs. This is another way to make commandoo useful for you. Maybe you want a GUI launcher database for all your programs. And another that just deals with hardware commands. Etc. Make commandoo yours. \n"
"\n"
"Almost every window in commandoo has a checkbox at upper right to show hints on mouse-over. Use it!! Lot's of information there. When you are done reading, uncheck it to stop the hints. The detailed hints for the Commands and CL's are only shown in edit mode, so be sure to go into the 2 edit modes to see those details. \n"
"\n"
"Heads UP: I ran into an odd problem with a couple of the more abstruse, esoteric Commands. When you add  a new Command the HELP and VERSION fields are filled in for you with the most common variants: \"--help\" and \"--version\". Upon entering a new Command I always check that these are correct for that Command, sometimes they aren't. Well, in a couple of cases running the \"--help\" threw me out of my session!! Surprise! I don't know why, it is hard to reproduce. But, for this reason, I recommend you test the help and version commands in a TERMINAL WINDOW first. \n"
