"commandoo has found that the program \"ibus\" is installed on your system. \n"
"\n"
"THIS CAN CAUSE PROGRAM MISBEHAVIOR, making commandoo unusable. The problem and solution are outlined below, but first use the copy to clipboard button above so that you can save this information and read it when commandoo is not running. \n"
"\n"
"==================== \n"
"The Problem: \n"
"Typed characters are doubled in some cases (solution below) \n"
"==================== \n"
"\n"
"In August 2017 (first official release of commandoo), I tested commandoo in a fresh Debian 9 cinnamon desktop. I found that the GTK version had the problem of doubled characters. That is, you type \"dog\" and you get \"ddoogg\", etc. This may be a problem in Debian 8 as well. \n"
"\n"
"Later in October a fresh install of KDE desktop Debian 9 also had this problem in the QT version. \n"
"\n"
"This was, of course, quite annoying. \n"
"\n"
"The problem is due to the program \"ibus\". ibus is an input method utility. It is designed to allow asian country users to type in their native language characters/idiograms: chinese, japanese, etc. So if you are not in Asia the program is not essential. However, it IS installed BY DEFAULT in fresh english installs of Debian. \n"
"\n"
"After finally testing (and researching) this thoroughly I found that the problem is rooted in ibus, or at least it's implementation. I can say this with confidence because while Lazarus programs have this problem it is ALSO A PROBLEM in KDE desktop environment (at least at this time, maybe it will be fixed??). \n"
"\n"
"On the fresh KDE install not only was commandoo affected but KDE windows (like kdesudo) failed, one can not type into the input fields. It also affects typing in the KDE kicker when trying to find some installed program, only the first typed character was displayed. Web research showed that many people are having this problem with KDE and Debian 9 and ibus. \n"
"\n"
"You will see immediately if you are affected by this problem. Simply close this window and continue on into commandoo. First thing type alt-F to open the find dialog and type \"dog\" if \"dog\" is the result then you do not have this problem. If it comes out only \"d\" or as \"ddoogg\" then you do have the problem and should apply the solution. \n"
"\n"
"When I discovered this back in August I recommended either removing ibus (if you are not typing asian characters) or a \"Fix\" I had found on the internet that seemed to work (setting some environment variables in .bashrc). Further testing in October with KDE showed the .bashrc \"solution\" was not effective though it had worked for me in August with GTK. That turned out to be due to how GTK enironment variable is set deep in the IM (input method) configuration files. So the solution DID NOT work with QT. At the time I had intended to try QT also but then the problem of not being able to use the GUI sudo commands (see above) convinced me that the KDE debian 9 install was flawed and I didn't bother. \n"
"\n"
"But, finally, in October I tried it again, and still KDE/PLasma wouldn't work properly (for example, one can not open synaptic package manager, while the password dialog shows you can't type anything into it! Ouch.). \n"
"\n"
"So I resolved to figure out the issue, and I did. Solution follows. \n"
"\n"
"==================== \n"
"Solution: \n"
"==================== \n"
"\n"
"As I said, I initially, in part, recommended removing ibus from your system if you didn't need it. \n"
"\n"
"And, as someone pointed out on the internet, to paraphrase: While ibus is now the default input method it doesn't mean you have to use it. There are other im's out there and you can set the system to use those (they also have to do with asian characters). And removing ibus should have no deleterious effects if you don't need it. \n"
"\n"
"So there is still that \"solution\". If you are having the doubled character problems you can temporarily see the \"fix\" immediately. Simply type \"ibus exit\" in a terminal. Go back into commandoo and the doubled character problem will be gone. But this is temporary, only shutting ibus down for the current session. On your next login ibus will be restarted. \n"
"\n"
"So removal of ibus will work. But I resolved to make my system work WITH ibus installed. And so here is the new tested and recommended solution: \n"
"\n"
"There turns out to be a small utility called im-config with which you can disable the asian character sub-system. \n"
"\n"
"You need to run it as root in this format:  sudo im-config -c \n"
"\n"
"The -c opens it in an interactive console mode in a terminal window. \n"
"\n"
"It will first list what the system currently is. This is usually defaulting to ibus. \n"
"\n"
"It will ask if you want to continue (yes). \n"
"\n"
"Then a screen will appear with your options. Use arrow keys to move to NONE choice, press spacebar to select it, then tab to OK and enter. \n"
"\n"
"NOTE: if you run im-config again it STILL says ibus is automatic, but this is not true absolutely, just in \"theory\" I guess (I really think someone, Linus?, needs to look into this mess), because if you continue you will see that the choice is still \"none\", which is correct. \n"
"\n"
"After this process logout/reboot and, voila, the system works. KDE works, I was able to open synaptic package manager, commandoo worked. The KDE Plasma Kicker worked. And ibus is still installed. \n"
"\n"
"I would apologize for the mess of this but it is the ibus team that should. \n"
"\n"

"Introduction:\n"
"============ \n"
"\n"
"Welcome to commandoo the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), perhaps better known as the \"Terminal\". You can read this introduction again later in the \"About\" window. Also available in the \"About\" window are some == TIPS == for use, recommended reading... \n"
"\n"
"It's purpose is to give you a place to store the cool and/or useful command lines you find, discover, or create. Then, months later, when you need it again, it will be here, easy to find. \n"
"\n"
"It's primary audience was intended for people new to Linux, but the features and usefulness of storing command lines could be of interest for veteran users too. \n"
"\n"
"You can copy the Command Line with a right click and paste into a Terminal to use...Or...\n"
"\n"
"...you can run it from within this program. Commandoo is NOT a terminal replacement, but it's been designed to be as useful as possible and running Command Line's seemed like a nice feature. \n"
"\n"
"Other features: \n"
"\n"
"** Commands and Command Lines can be marked as to how dangerous they are, and you can optionally set that a particular danger level (harmless, careful, caution, danger) needs confirmation before running. \n"
"\n"
"** You can mark a command line to take input from you, before running. Not all Commands pay any attention to input (stdin) but for the ones that do this is kind of a cool feature. Think grep for instance. \n"
"\n"
"** You can test your command lines while editing them. The only thing this program does NOT provide is a shell within which to run commands. So running commands from here like \"cd\", \"pwd\", \"alias\" and some others like these are, well, useless to run from here. But even these are included in the database for reference since the program can show the command's help text for you. \n"
"\n"
"** You can add any number of self defined keywords to a command and these, of course, are searchable. \n"
"\n"
"There is one other thing to know about the absence of a \"true\" shell: you can't change directories (cd) to run a command in that directory. For instance, if you choose to add \"git\" to your Commands you need to use it with the \"-C <path>\" flag. This is true of any command like git, you will need to use pathing and appropriate flags to run it. And the last BIG difference: any command that expects input will NOT run properly because I haven't figured out how to communicate (yet) with a running process in a shell-like manner waiting for input. These have to be run in a terminal. \n"
"\n"
"You can choose to use text based database files or sqlite db files. You can convert from one to the other. You can merge from one to the other. You can send individual Command Lines from your open db and send it to another db.\n"
"\n"
"This is completely \"open\" software, the source code is on GitHub, see the link in the \"About\" window. It is written in pascal (thank you FreePascal) with the Lazarus IDE (thank you Lazarus). \n"
"\n"
"Help is included in the program. Almost all windows have a checkbox in the upper right to \"show hints on mouseover\". Check that and then move the mouse over the control you have a question about. \n"
"\n"
"A word of CAUTION:     Be careful out there. \n"
"\n"
"Linux comes with very powerful commands to use, really cool ones. But they can be dangerous if misused and/or misunderstood. As they say with great power comes great responsibility. \n"
"\n"
"If you don't know whether a command is dangerous or not then you really need to educate yourself about that command. Hopefully this database will help you with that. I will try to be as thorough as possible in the database descriptions of a command's merits. And, in the original database coming with this program, if I have marked a command line as harmless then it IS harmless you can be certain. If a command line is marked careful or higher then you may want to spend some time learning about that command so you understand WHY it is not completely harmless. \n"
"\n"
"Another word of CAUTION:     Backup your database files regularly. File locations can be seen in the \"About\" window. And now License Information: \n"

"TIPS:\n"
"===== \n"
"\n"
"Commands are entries that describe the command you are using. Commands >> CAN NOT BE RUN <<. Only Command Lines can be run, but you must add the command first. Then you add command lines to it. \n"
"\n"
"Before adding Command Lines you should edit your new Command and give it a threat level and so on. This is because any command lines you add will \"inherit\" those settings (excepting the notes and KeyWords) saving you some work. \n"
"\n"
"Note for Debian users: If an entered command you know you should have and it comes back with \"badpath\" this is probably because the command is in /sbin/ and not in your $PATH. Edit the Command (go into edit mode and double click the command name) and simply type the /sbin/ manually. /sbin/ commands are usually reserved for ROOT users and so will not be seen by the program under your normal login. \n"
"\n"
"commandoo supports variables in Command Lines. Highlight the CL you want and go into edit mode. Double click the command line and you will be taken to a edit window that has buttons to allow you to enter various types of variables (strings, integer, real, and file/folder names).  \n"
"\n"
"Look through the provided database, there are examples of variables, Command Line input, etc. \n"
"\n"
"One cool options is \"Alert\". If this is checked then the program makes you look at the notes for that Command Line. This can be really useful if you need to be aware of something, or having done something, BEFORE you run that command line. Try it. \n"
"\n"
"If you want commandoo to act as a \"launcher\" be sure to check the \"Child Proc\" checkbox in the Command Line. Otherwise, it will (usually) return immediately, having not done anything. Say you are running Gimp or Blender, well sending it out to be run like \"uname\" does precisely that. It runs it, and then stops and kills it. The Child Proc setting says \"hey, this is GUI program, keep it open\". \n"
"\n"
"\"Use Shell\" attempts to let the system handle it and this usually works pretty well. It is necessary for processes that use more terminal like syntax (semicolons and such). commandoo can internally handle the basic command lines, but if yours doesn't seem to work, try Use Shell and see if that does it. If not then that Command Line should only be run in a Terminal (term. only). \n"
"\n"
"If the Command Line is mission critical, complex, etc. you should probably only use it in a Terminal. commandoo is pretty good at performing most CL's but IT IS NOT A TERMINAL, be aware of that and use your best judgement on where commandoo can/should be used and where a Terminal should be used. \n"
"\n"
"\"Wants Input\" is pretty cool (I think). On Commands that accept input (like, for instance, grep) marking this option for a Command Line will ask you for input before running the Command Line. So for something like grep you can paste in some text you want to search. \n"
"\n"
"SuperUser (you can set details in OPTIONS): how this works varies on your distribution. If you are on Debian there is an admin user and then your personal login. If you are not part of \"sudo'ers\" then you can not run Commands as ROOT and you will need to know the admin password. For 'buntu distribs this is not the case unless you have set your system up specifically as such. See OPTIONS for SuperUser for more details. \n"
"\n"
"Use DB profiles, why not? The provided database is of basic Linux commands. Now you can add more and more to this database as you like, fine. But you could also make specific databases for specific needs. This is another way to make commandoo useful for you. Maybe you want a GUI launcher database for all your programs. And another that just deals with hardware commands. Etc. Make commandoo yours. \n"
"\n"
"Almost every window in commandoo has a checkbox at upper right to show hints on mouseover. Use it!! Lot's of information there. When you are done reading, uncheck it to stop the hints. The detailed hints for the Commands and CL's are only shown in edit mode. \n"
"\n"
"Heads UP: I ran into an odd problem with a couple of the more abstruse, esoteric Commands. When you add  a new Command the HELP and VERSION fields are filled in for you with the most common variants: \"--help\" and \"--version\". Upon entering a new Command I always check that these are correct for that Command, sometimes they aren't. Well, in a couple of cases running the \"--help\" threw me out of my session!! Surprise! I don't know why, it is hard to reproduce. But, for this reason, I recommend you test the help and version commands in a TERMINAL WINDOW first. \n"
