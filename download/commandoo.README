The file:  commandoo_folder.tar.gz

...has a readme.txt file with detailed install information.

It is the homebase folder for the commandoo executable, and has a starter 
DataBase (170+ commands) and example searches. You can add as many 
databases as you like.
  
Download the variety of commandoo archive file you want, unarchive the executable, and place it in that uncompressed folder. You can also place your commandoo executable in any home folder you like but you will then not have the starter database initially and would have to point to them using the database management window. Ensure the commandoo file is marked as executable, and, if you have the QT version, that the library libqt4pas5 is already on your system (if not get it from standard repostitories).

The file po_translations_1.0.1.tar.gz:

These contain the up to date translations for version 1.0.1, and only needed by people upgrading or installing customized fashion. The commandoo_folder.tar.gz file has the latest versions of everything and that should be used for new installs.

====

BE AWARE that the QT versions will -NOT- run if this library is not 
installed on your system:

libqt4pas5


This library is found in all the standard repositories, use package manager 
or apt-get.
