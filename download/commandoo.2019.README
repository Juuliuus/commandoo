Summary:

For those finding difficulty finding the required libqt4pas5 library
(required to run the commandoo QT version) in their linux flavour
repositories I now include a DEB file which will install this library.


Hi, new information as of the beginning of the year 2019
regarding the libqt4pas5 library that is needed for the QT version.
It is now included here with libqt4pas5_2.5-15_amd64.deb file,
read on for details.

As mentioned (just about everywhere) the library libqt4pas5 is REQUIRED 
to run the QT version (commandoo was developed with QT4). I then said, 
"This library is found in all the standard repositories, use package manager 
or apt-get."

But I ran into a surprise when I installed Kubuntu 18.04 recently...that library is NOT
available in the standard repository!!

Imagine my surprise. Worse, when I tried to get a copy on my system so I could
run commandoo, it was difficult to find. But find it I finally did.

Now I know for a fact that libqt4pas5 is still available in Debian 9 repo but the 'Ubuntu
branches apparently have left it behind as they are now (or may be) using only QT5.

SOLUTION
========
So the upshot is that if you can not find libqt4pas5 in your repository I now include the
file "libqt4pas5_2.5-15_amd64.deb" (this is for 64 bit machines only) here with the downloads and with which you should be able to install libqt4pas5 with a right click choosing "Qapt" (or use apt or dpkg).

I apolgize for the bother but I am a bit astounded that the ubuntu branch took it out
of their repositories. Why? Anyway, this deb worked for me and commandoo (QT) now works fine
on my new Kubuntu 18.04 install.

Side Note:
==========
I also signed the copy of libqt4pas5_2.5-15_amd64.deb file. I did NOT develop this file, I found
it on the internet. But, on installing it, the correct library was placed on my system and 
commandoo would finally run. So, my signature on this deb file is only to let you know the copy 
you download here is the one I used and which I found worked correctly.

Side Side Note:
===============
You can find a similar file in 'buntu repos: libqt5pas1. This allows programs written in Lazarus
using QT5 widgetset to work. But the installation of that library does not allow commandoo to work. So in future I hope to make compile a QT5 version, but there is no rush. The commandoo QT4 version works fine (as long as you have the libqt4pas5 library).
